Revised by:    Matt Deatherage                                  November 1990
Written by:    Eric Soldan                                          July 1989

This Technical Note discusses application difficulties when transferring
control to dynamic segments during low-memory conditions.
Changes since July 1989:  The information formerly covered in this Note is now
discussed in greater detail in Apple IIgs Technical Note #22, Proper Use of
Dynamic Segments.
_____________________________________________________________________________

This Note formerly warned of the dangers of using dynamic segments-if memory is
not available for the dynamic segment, the system crashes.  Apple IIgs
Technical Note #22, Proper Use of Dynamic Segments, covers this problem and
strategies for working around it.
