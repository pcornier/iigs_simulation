Apple IIGS
#14:    Standard File Calls and GrafPort Records

Revised by:    Matt Deatherage                                  November 1988
Written by:    Guillermo Ortiz                                      June 1987

This Technical Note formerly described how Standard File 1.1 and earlier did 
not preserve the GrafPort around Standard File calls and recommended that you 
save and restore the GrafPort around Standard File calls.
_____________________________________________________________________________

Standard File 2.0 fixes a bug present in earlier versions which did not 
preserve the GrafPort around Standard File calls.  You should not have to 
write a special case to handle this bug since it is reasonable to expect users 
to be running your program from a current System Disk (Standard File 2.0 is 
available in System Disks after 1.1).

You can still save and restore the GrafPort around Standard File calls as it 
will still work, but doing so will increase the size of your code and cause 
unnecessary overhead during execution.
