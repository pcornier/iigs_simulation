Apple IIGS
#45:    Parameters for GetFrameColor

Revised by:    Matt Deatherage                                 September 1989
Written by:    Dan Oliver                                       November 1988

This Technical Note formerly attempted to correct the description of the 
parameters passed to and returned from the routine GetFrameColor in the Window 
Manager chapter of the Apple IIGS Toolbox Reference.  This call works as 
documented since System Software 3.2; therefore, former versions of this Note 
were incorrect.
Changes since November 1988:  Corrected our error.  Sorry for any 
inconvenience.
_____________________________________________________________________________

This Note formerly stated the following:  "The Apple IIGS Toolbox Reference, 
Volume 2 incorrectly describes the parameters passed to and returned from 
GetFrameColor on page 25-57."

However, this is incorrect.  Beginning with System Software 3.2, GetFrameColor 
works as documented in the Apple IIGS Toolbox Reference, Volume 2.  Prior to 
System Software 3.2, the call did not work at all.  We apologize for any 
inconvenience this confusion may have caused.
