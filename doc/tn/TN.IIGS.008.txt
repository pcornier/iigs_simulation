Apple IIGS
#8:    Elems Functions in IIGS SANE

Revised by:    Matt Deatherage                                  November 1988
Written by:    Guillermo Ortiz                                  December 1986

This Technical Note discusses a problem which existed with the Elems functions 
in the IIGS SANE Tool Set 1.0.  Current IIGS System Disks contain a patch 
which corrects this problem.
_____________________________________________________________________________

Calls to any of the Elems functions in version 1.0 of the IIGS SANE Tool Set 
may return an invalid result unless you are evaluating data which resides in 
bank $00 due to a problem with the Elems parameter passing mechanism.  These 
results are random because when SANE checks the validity of its input, it uses 
values that have no relations to the actual ones, and once it completes the 
validation, it uses the real operands.

All System Disks released on or after December 1, 1986 include a RAM patch 
which fixes the Elems parameter passing mechanism; therefore, you should not 
have to write a special case to handle this problem if you are shipping your 
application with the most recent Apple IIGS System Disk.  You should contact 
Apple Software Licensing at Apple Computer, Inc.; 20525 Mariani Avenue, M/S 
38-I; Cupertino, CA 95014 or (408) 974-4667 to obtain the most recent version 
of the Apple IIGS System Disk.
